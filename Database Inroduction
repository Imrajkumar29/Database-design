Database 
A Database stores data. Collection of Related Data that represent some Real world entities.
provdies orgatanisational structure for data
Mechanism to query, creating, modifying, delete date.(CRUD)

Issues with traditional file systems - redundancy, inconsistency

Data - Facts that can be recorded. eg.Texts, Numbers,Videos,Images,Audio
Information - Meaningful/Processed Data

Components of Database systems are Users->,Database Applications(Website)->, DBMS->, Database.
Databse contains user data ,Metadata, Indexes /other overhead data and Application metadata.
Metadata are data describing the structure of the data in the database.

DBMS -Software tool to manage data.

Relational database - stores data in tables. 
Columns/Fields/Attributes - represent different attributes of the entity
rows/Records/Tuples - represent different instances of the entity

Entity - person, order ,customer (i.e) anything that we store data about.
Attribute - character , hair colour, name , dress style etc

Referential Integrity Constraint - helps to keep the data consistent. 
consider dept(id -15,16,17) and employee tables. If we try to add an employee with dept id 18 in employee table it will not allow.

Keys 
Super Key - Attribute/Set of attribute used to uniquely identify a record. 
maximum superkeys - for a table with 5 columns -> 2 (power^ n) -1 = 32 -1 =31 
for 4 columns -> 4C1+4C2+4C3+4C4 = 4+6+4+1= 15 which is the same when calculated using 2 (power^ n)-1 formula.
